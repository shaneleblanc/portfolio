## Git
+ Make a new branch for each feature you work on
+ **Merge Conflicts**: when two people work on the same file in the same code location.. a merge conflict happens. Whoever does the merge will have to decide which takes precedence. If it sees that you both worked on the same part it will say merge failed / fix conflicts
#### Key Terms
+ Mind the company's policy for branching
+ pull request - a formalized review process for merging a branch (or called a "merge request")
+ *clone* copy + download remote repo
+ *remote* a git repository elswhere, but associated with your code, so it is kept "backed up"
+ *pull* grab changes from remote
+ *push* upload your changes to remote
